# TrackAS MVP - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Database Setup

Your Supabase database is already configured. Now apply the migration:

1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project: `qdzqyzdyrtkfbbjbhdbe`
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Copy the entire content from: `supabase/migrations/20250715000000_trackas_mvp_complete.sql`
5. Paste into SQL Editor and click **Run**

### Step 2: Verify Migration

After running the migration, verify these tables exist:

```sql
-- Quick verification query
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

Expected tables (18 total):
- admin_settings
- ai_assistant_logs
- commission_transactions
- disputes
- drivers
- escrow_transactions
- fleet_operators
- fleet_subscriptions
- individual_operators
- proof_of_delivery
- shipment_assignments
- shipments
- subscription_plans
- tracking_links
- vehicles

### Step 3: Verify Admin Settings

```sql
-- Check admin settings
SELECT * FROM admin_settings;
```

You should see:
- ✅ commission_percentage: 5%
- ✅ subscription_enabled: true
- ✅ assignment_timeout_seconds: 120
- ✅ dynamic_pricing_escalation: {"first_retry": 10, "second_retry": 20, "third_retry": 0}
- ✅ max_assignment_retries: 3

### Step 4: Verify Subscription Plans

```sql
-- Check subscription plans
SELECT name, billing_cycle, vehicle_range_min, vehicle_range_max, price_inr
FROM subscription_plans;
```

You should see 3 plans:
- ✅ Small Fleet (1-5 vehicles): ₹5,000/month
- ✅ Medium Fleet (6-20 vehicles): ₹15,000/month
- ✅ Large Fleet (21+ vehicles): ₹35,000/month

### Step 5: Create Test Admin User (Optional)

If you want to test the admin dashboard:

```sql
-- This would be done through Supabase Auth UI
-- For now, use the existing auth system in the app
```

### Step 6: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app will be available at: http://localhost:5173

*(Implementation connects to Twilio, SendGrid, or AWS SNS)*

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ Authenticated access for operations
- ✅ Admin-only access for settings
- ✅ Escrow transactions protected
- ✅ Audit logging via triggers

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration fails
**Solution**: Ensure you're using Supabase SQL Editor, not a local PostgreSQL client. Some features (like `gen_random_uuid()`) are Supabase-specific.

### Issue: Assignment not working
**Solution**: Check `admin_settings` table. Ensure `assignment_timeout_seconds` has a valid value (e.g., 120).

### Issue: Tracking link doesn't work
**Solution**:
1. Check `tracking_links` table for the token
2. Ensure token matches shipment_id
3. Verify RLS policy allows public read

### Issue: Payment not released
**Solution**:
1. Verify shipment status is 'delivered'
2. Check `escrow_transactions` table status
3. Ensure trigger `create_escrow_on_shipment` fired

### Issue: Subscription not giving priority
**Solution**:
1. Check `admin_settings`: `subscription_enabled` must be `true`
2. Verify fleet subscription status is 'active'
3. Check `end_date` is in the future
