## Services Implementation

### 1. Assignment Service (`src/services/assignmentService.ts`)

#### Features:
- **2-Minute Timeout**: Configurable from admin settings
- **Subscription Priority**: Subscribed fleets get first opportunity
- **FCFS Assignment**: First-come-first-served for all operators
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Automatic escalation (10%, 20%, 30%)
- **Retry Logic**: Max 3 cycles before cancellation

#### Usage:
```typescript
import { assignmentService } from './services/assignmentService';

// Initiate assignment
const result = await assignmentService.initiateAssignment(shipmentId);

// Accept assignment (operator)
const accepted = await assignmentService.acceptAssignment(assignmentId, operatorId);

// Reject assignment
const rejected = await assignmentService.rejectAssignment(assignmentId, operatorId, reason);
```

### 2. Escrow Service (`src/services/escrowService.ts`)

#### Features:
- **Commission Management**: Update commission % (admin only)
- **Escrow Operations**: Create, hold, release, refund
- **Subscription Management**: Create, update, process payments
- **Analytics**: Revenue tracking and reporting

#### Usage:
```typescript
import { escrowService } from './services/escrowService';

// Create escrow transaction
const transaction = await escrowService.createEscrowTransaction(
  shipmentId,
  shipperId,
  amount,
  commissionPercentage
);

// Release payment on delivery
await escrowService.releaseEscrowPayment(transactionId);

// Refund on cancellation
await escrowService.refundEscrowPayment(transactionId, reason);
```

## Assignment Logic Flow

### Subscription Priority Mode (If Enabled)

1. **Check Subscription Status**
   - Query active fleet subscriptions
   - Filter by approved fleet operators
   - Sort by reliability score

2. **Find Best Fleet Match**
   - Vehicle type matching
   - Capacity verification
   - Distance from pickup
   - Reliability score

3. **Send Assignment Request**
   - Tag specific vehicle number
   - 2-minute countdown starts
   - Fleet owner must accept/reject

4. **On Fleet Rejection/Timeout**
   - Move to next subscribed fleet
   - Continue until all subscribed fleets exhausted
   - Fall back to FCFS mode

### FCFS Mode (Default or Fallback)

1. **Broadcast to All Operators**
   - All eligible fleet vehicles
   - All eligible individual operators
   - Filtered by vehicle type and availability

2. **First Acceptance Wins**
   - Real-time monitoring for responses
   - First to accept within 2 minutes gets shipment
   - Others marked as timeout

3. **On No Acceptance**
   - Escalate to dynamic pricing

### Dynamic Pricing Escalation

1. **First Retry (10% increase)**
   - Update shipment price
   - Notify shipper
   - Re-run assignment logic
   - 2-minute window

2. **Second Retry (20% increase)**
   - Further price increase
   - Notify shipper
   - Re-run assignment logic
   - 2-minute window

3. **Third Retry (30% increase - Optional)**
   - Final price increase
   - Last attempt
   - If no acceptance → Auto-cancel

4. **Auto-Cancel After Max Retries**
   - Cancel shipment
   - Refund escrow amount
   - Notify shipper
   - Log for admin review

4. **Maps Integration**: Uses mock data. Integrate with Google Maps/Mapbox.

5. **AI Assistant**: Basic implementation. Enhance with actual AI model integration.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Mobile Apps**: iOS and Android native apps for operators
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for predictive insights
3. **Multi-currency Support**: International shipments
4. **Document OCR**: Auto-extract data from uploaded documents
