# 📋 **TRACKAS PROJECT - COMPLETE SUMMARY & STATUS**

## 🚨 **WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PROJECT**

### **The Issue:**
During the recent git operations, **many critical files were accidentally deleted**. This happened because:

1. **Git Rebase Conflict**: When we tried to push changes, there was a conflict with the remote repository
2. **File Deletion**: During the rebase process, many newly created files were lost
3. **Missing Components**: The new user role implementations (Admin, Shipper, Fleet, Individual, Customer) are now missing

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Core Project**: Still intact and functional
- ❌ **New User Roles**: Missing (Admin, Shipper, Fleet, Individual, Customer)
- ✅ **Database**: Complete with all migrations
- ✅ **Basic Features**: Working (original MVP features)
